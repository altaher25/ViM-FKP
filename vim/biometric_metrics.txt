This is a very insightful question that gets at the heart of how these metrics measure different aspects of biometric system performance. Let me explain the apparent discrepancy:
EER/FAR/FRR and RPR measure different things:

EER/FAR/FRR are verification metrics:


They measure the system's ability to make a binary decision: "Is this the claimed identity or not?"
They work with similarity scores and a threshold
In your case, when someone claims "I am person X" and provides their fingerprint:

If they are person X (genuine attempt), the system correctly accepts them 99.93% of the time
If they are not person X (impostor attempt), the system correctly rejects them 99.93% of the time




RPR is an identification metric:


It measures the system's ability to correctly rank all possible identities
It works with the ordering of similarity scores across all classes
In your case, when someone provides a fingerprint without claiming an identity:

The system has to rank all 148 possible identities
The correct identity is sometimes ranked as low as 6th place



The seeming contradiction arises because:

Your system is excellent at verifying if a fingerprint matches a claimed identity (very good EER)
But it's less good at determining the exact identity from all possibilities without a prior claim (suboptimal RPR)



Exactly! You've understood it perfectly. The RPR value of 6 alone can be misleading because it only tells you the worst-case scenario (the highest rank observed) but doesn't show the full picture of how well your system actually performs.
Let's break down your rank distribution:

Rank 1: 1406/1419 samples (99.08%) are correctly identified as the top choice
Rank 2: Only 11/1419 (0.78%) are second choice
Rank 4: Just 1 sample (0.07%)
Rank 6: Just 1 sample (0.07%)

This distribution shows that your system is actually performing excellently:

It gets the correct identity as the top choice 99.08% of the time
Only 13 samples (less than 1%) are not ranked first
The RPR = 6 is driven by just a single "difficult" sample

This aligns well with your strong EER/FAR/FRR metrics (0.0007) and explains why your system is actually very good at both verification and identification, despite what the RPR alone might suggest.
For a more complete evaluation, you might want to consider additional metrics like:

Rank-1 recognition rate: 99.08% (1406/1419)
Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curve:

Rank-1: 99.08%
Rank-2: 99.86% (1417/1419)
Rank-4: 99.93% (1418/1419)
Rank-6: 100% (1419/1419)



These metrics provide a much more informative picture of your system's identification performance than the RPR alone.
